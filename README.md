# Bitcoin Tracker frontend 
Bitcoin Tracker frontend is the frontend that fetches and displays real-time Bitcoin price data from the [bitcoin-tracker-backend](https://github.com/felipeNeves93/bitcoin-tracker/tree/master) project. It provides users with the latest Bitcoin price and a daily summary of price variations, styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript using Vite, while the backend is powered by FastAPI and SQLite.

- **Daily Summary View**: Shows the maximum and minimum Bitcoin prices for the current day, along with the percentage variation.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically refreshes data every 30 seconds.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
- **Environment Configuration**: Backend host is configurable via an environment variable (VITE_APP_HOST).

### Tech Stack
